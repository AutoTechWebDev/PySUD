# PySUD 
## Python Based Terminal Single User Dungeon Game Updated: 1/5/2014 

### Currently Functioning/Fleshed Out - 
#### PySUD_character_creation 
#### PySUD_character_races

Running PySUD_character_creation will allow you to create a new character and will save the finished character as a text file in the /players directory as a .txt file (See Collezio.txt as example) (the /players directory will need to be created if the folder is not already there. )
